    <h1>The Best Movies According To Batool</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>It came out two weeks ago and I love how it gives an empowering message and the visually stunning animation makes it worth the watch.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>As someone who is a fan of sci-fi and astronomy I can say that Interstellar is a mesmerizing cinematic experience that transcends the boundaries of science fiction. The cinematography of the film is simply breathtaking.</p>
<h3>Spirited away</h3>
<p>Comfort movie. I love ghibli studio movies because they have the prettiest animation.</p>
